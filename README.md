This project is a job ranker system that uses sentiment analysis to score job reviews, rank jobs under different categories and classify ranked jobs according to user preferences. The system is designed to help job seekers find the best jobs that match their interests and requirements, and to help employers get feedback on their jobs and identify areas for improvement. The system uses an LSTM model to extract the sentiments of job reviews and generate a rating for the job. The system also takes into account user preferences, such as work-life balance, culture and diversity to rank and classify jobs. Job Ranker provides a user-friendly mobile interface for users to easily find the best jobs that match their needs and interests.
The evaluation of the system is conducted on the Glassdoor job reviews data set, resulting in an accuracy of 81% in sentiment classification. This indicates the system's effectiveness in extracting sentiments from job reviews and generating accurate job ratings. Furthermore, the use of MySQL for complex database management of review data enables the storage and management of large amounts of data, ensuring reliable and accurate results for the system.
